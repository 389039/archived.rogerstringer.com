Interesting approach to Agile Development…

> Agile web development is not a specific process, action, or a daylong exercise. Agile is a mindset, an attitude with which a project is undertaken. It means streamlining the project, taking away time-sucks, performing frequent sanity checks, and making sure that youre not spending excessive time on things that dont add value to the project. Its about spending quality time on actions that add value to the website and make it better, and taking away time and energy from parts of the process that cause headaches.
