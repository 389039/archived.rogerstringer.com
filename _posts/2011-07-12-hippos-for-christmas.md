My 3 year old daughter is a huge fan of Shirley Temple, and with her own curly hair, gets told she looks like Shirley Temple all the time.

She also memorizes all of her favourite songs..

This song is one of the songs I get to hear her sing every day, so since I finally managed to catch her singing without seeing my iPhone, I decided to hit record and grab a copy to share with everyone.

So now, without further adieu, I give you “I want a hippopotamus for christmas”
