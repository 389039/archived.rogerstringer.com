Currently busy on a new project that I hope will be a neat idea and a great success, not gonna get into too many details here today, just gonna say that it will definitely change how things are done on the web.

Been playing with some ajax interfaces lately, they’re pretty cool and I may have to do more with them shortly.

Other than that, just been busy with the move and work and getting ready for my vacation next week. Heading back to Newfoundland for 10 days of relaxation and visiting ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
