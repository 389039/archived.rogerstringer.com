Today we launched our latest site, [Whatâ€™s Cooking Today](http://www.whats-cooking-today.com). This new cooking site is a followup to our webvolve site, but going along a new path. We will be featuring new recipes each week and also doing a tips section for those who want tips on things like garnishing, choosing the right wine, eating heathier, etc. Expect new recipes and a soon to be launched podcast as well to give you hints and tips for cooking today.
