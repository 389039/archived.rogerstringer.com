I’ve been busy on a new wordpress plugin that will be launching soon that is pretty cool. Some details about it: turn any wordpress-powered site into a social network, complete with profile page, wall, favourites, friends, the works. There’ll be more to come in the next couple weeks, but it’s a pretty cool plugin so far. Otherwise, busy with a mobile version of [projectpiece.com](http://www.projectpiece.com), and the final touches of [DBStract.com](http://www.dbstract.com)’s mobile interface.

*Just a quick note, **friendz** hasn’t been released yet, I have a spot set up on the wordpress repository because I go between multiple workstations and also so that when I do release it in the next couple weeks, there’s no waiting around like there was when I did newspage. Release is aimed for sometime in the next two weeks, so please have some patience, I promise it will be well worth it.*
