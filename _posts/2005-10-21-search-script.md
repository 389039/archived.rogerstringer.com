I finished work on my new site search engine script last night.

This script crawls a web site and then lets people search the pages of that site. It’s pretty cool and fast. Gonna set it up on a couple sites that I own to try it out. I also set it up to be able to create a google sitemap from the links it crawls so it will serve two purposes.

I like having a seperate search engine script instead of building it straight into the scripts because this way, it gets to stay universal through it all.

My plan is to brand it to sell after it gets a good workout on my sites.

Other than that, my overstock script is almost done and the site I’m putting it on is almost ready to go. Just a few kinks to iron out.

On a final note, that mobiTV that came built into my cell phone is pretty cool.
