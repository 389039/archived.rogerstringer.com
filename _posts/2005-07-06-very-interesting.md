So, a few weeks ago I launched [article-base.info](http://www.article-base.info), my new article site. Since creating it, I’ve been getting at least 10 article submissions a day and a ton of hits. I would have started up massive article sites sooner if I’d known they were gonna get so much traffic ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

But seriously, I have other plans for that site. I plan to set it up to offer articles via email so others can publish them on their sites and also sell a script that can work in conjunction with that.

Also working on a few other new sites and scripts as well for the next coming weeks.
