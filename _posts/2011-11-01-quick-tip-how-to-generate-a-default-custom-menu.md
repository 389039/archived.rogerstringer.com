Nice ideas…

> Custom menus are obviously a major part of WordPress at this point something that users have been begging for since 2.x. The only problem is that you typically would want to provide some default menu items with any new theme you release. For instance a Home page link, or maybe a few menu items that require custom classes such as a Twitter link with a matching Twitter icon or a Subscribe link with a matching RSS icon. Sure, you could hard code these items within your theme files, but that kind of defeats the purpose of custom menus.
