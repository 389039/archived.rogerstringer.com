So, as of this weekend, all the links pages on all of my sites get their links from the same place.

Thanks to that web services system, I only have to update one list of links in one area, and all the links update on every site. ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

I like it, keeps it nice and simple.
