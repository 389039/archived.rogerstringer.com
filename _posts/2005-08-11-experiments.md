Ok, so today I decided to start trying some new experiments to start monetizing my web sites more. I get lots of traffic from them so I decided it was time to start doing something with them.

First, I changed [http://www.article-base.info](http://www.article-base.info) to display 3 types of adsense ads, so I’ll give them a week or so to see how it goes.

Then, I changed [http://www.your-mac-store.com](http://www.your-mac-store.com) to have different types of ads too.

The two of them use a different format so I’ll try them both and see what the end results end up being. ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
