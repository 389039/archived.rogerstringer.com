So, about a month ago, I decided to try a new Amazon site. One that was a very specific niche site.

My last few Amazon sites have been kind of broad. One on electronics which meant all electronics, etc. So I set this new site up, and put it to work. Iâ€™ve now managed to make as much from that one site in one month as I have made from all my other sites combined in that same month.

This is sweet, so now I need some new niche site ideas so that I can stop with the broad sites.
