This morning, we launched our latest site [123 Send It](http://www.123-send-it.com), this site is a sister site to our image hosting site, and allows for securely sending files to others. A user uploads a file to our server, and an email is sent to the person he is sending the file to containing instructions to download the file. Fast, easy, and simple. Just the way these sites should be.
