Today, I’m pleased to announce that one of my longer standing sites is no more. Why am I pleased to announce that? Because in killing the site, I have brought into a new name that will continue to grow. A few months ago, I started work on a site called “[The Dev Scene](http://www.thedevscene.com)”, the idea was that eventually QuickPipe would get moved over to it and cease to exist. Today, I’m happy to say that this time has come. There’s still some rought spots to iron out, but overall, I’m pretty happy with it.
