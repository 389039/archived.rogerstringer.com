Over the last 24 hours, [The Dev Scene](http://thedevscene.com) has been moved to a new home, it is now located at [Attack Of Code](http://attackofcode.com)

The reason for this move is that new plans have come up for this domain, but I wanted to keep the articles live and had also already been planning on launching [Attack of Code](http://attackofcode.com) anyway, so it made sense.

Attack of Code was built using a heavily modified version of the Seven Five theme from [press75.com](http://press75.com). It was originally set to use feeds from vimeo, youtube and also from delicious, but I changed it to instead work with custom post formats.

Some more changes will come to Attack of Code over the next few weeks, and it’s a project I’m looking forward to.
