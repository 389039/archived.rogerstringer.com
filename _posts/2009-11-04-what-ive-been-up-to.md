Ok, I admit I got a little slow with posting again. I got a little busy the past few weeks. Some things I’ve been up to:

1. [fastAmazon](http://themeforest.net/item/fastamazon/63770) has been selling better than I expected so I was busy with updates on that.
2. [KudosCMS](http://www.kudoscms.com/) has just gotten version 1.1 released and 1.2 is in the planning stages which will include the ability to add custom plugins.
3. [Foodizu](http://www.foodizu.com) has seen some new updates and I’ve been busy working on the iPhone app that will feature over 40,000 recipes when it launches. *(Lots of yummy tasty food)*
4. [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com) has been getting some new updates as well, but mostly they’ve been in the backend as I’ve added new infrastructure to how it handles it’s thousands of databases.
5. New articles for [QuickPipe.com](http://www.quickpipe.com), which will be getting added this week.
6. Being a dad, and watching my daughter learn new things every week.
7. Being forced to watch Monsters Vs Aliens, 101 Dalmations 2, and madagascar 2 over and over and over and over :) Otherwise, I’ve got some new projects on the horizon that I’ll be talking about more soon.
