Thanksgiving 2010 has arrived and you find yourself pausing to think of everything you are thankful for. First of all, I am thankful for my wife and daughter, as well as our extended family members who are always there to lend a hand. Next, Iâ€™d have to be thankful for friends, colleagues and peers with whom we have built a strong network amongst ourselves. As an aside, I have a few new projects in the pipeline that promise to be pretty interesting as they launch so stay tuned.
