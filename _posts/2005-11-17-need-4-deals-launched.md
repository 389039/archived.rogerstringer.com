Ok, after a few months of work building a site that can take any datafeed and add it’s product to the DB, I finally launched [Need 4 Deals](http://www.need4deals.com/) this week.

The site launched with 10 merchants and over 15,000 products.

I’ve still got more to add to it before I’m done.

On another note, I’ve set up a few of my sites to do tracking via [google’s new analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) site. So far, the reports back have been pretty useful and interesting.
