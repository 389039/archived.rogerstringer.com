Ok, yeah, I know itâ€™s been a few months since my last post.

Things have been busy with work, projects and life.

<table><tr><td> One of the things that have been busy is that we recently got a new puppy named Bailey. He is a cross Maltese / Bichon and you can see him in the pic on the right. </td><td>![Bailey flying](http://www.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/100_0074.thumbnail.JPG)</td></tr></table>He has been a bit of a handful, and aside from that, work has been busy.

Will promise to update more in the future.
