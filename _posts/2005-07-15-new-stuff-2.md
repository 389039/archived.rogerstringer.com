So, over the weekend, I launched [http://www.your-mac-store.com](http://www.your-mac-store.com), which as the name says, is an Amazon store dedicated to Mac products.

I also added some RSS feeds to the site which are all related to Macs. Iâ€™m interested to see how it turns out.

Working on a few new scripts for my script site and also getting some new sites ready to launch.
