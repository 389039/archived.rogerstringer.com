**Talk like a pirate Day** will be here on September 19th, and in honor of it, the folks at the Yahoo! Developer Network have made a handy little javascript file that you can insert into your website to convert the text of the site to pirate talk. Just insert this javascript link into the bottom of your pages to automatically change them to pirate speak after the page has loaded.
