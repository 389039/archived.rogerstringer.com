Last night, Patsy and I went to see the movie Serenity.

I’ve been a fan of the FireFly series for a long time and have the entire series memorized (it’s not hard, there are only 15 episodes), and I liked this movie.

I know, everyone with a blog is talking about this movie this week so my post is nothing new, but I wanted to give it a mention anyway.

My only complaint was they killed off the show’s funniest character. Wash was the guy who made the show interesting and any future movies or shows that may come out of this movie just won’t be the same.

Other than that, let’s see more of the FireFly class ship called Serenity.
