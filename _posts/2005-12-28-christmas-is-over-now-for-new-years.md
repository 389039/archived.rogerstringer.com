Christmas was fine. Spent some time with friends and family. Hung out, watched movies, opened presents.

Got a Sirius Satelite Radio for the car for christmas. That thing is pretty cool. Over 100 channels. Octane is the best.

So, it’s now 7:20. I overlsept today after having 5 days off from work and was in a rush to get to the office. Didn’t even have time to make lunch before I left.

On another note, I’m back to work on my new cooking site. I abandoned the design I was playing with to go with a design based on the freekrai.net template which is fine since I want to keep everything more uniform and I like that design anyway. Everything’s nearly done on that site, just have to add some more recipes and finish working out the colors I want to use.
