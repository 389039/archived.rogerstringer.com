Ok, so that title may make no sense, unless you have to deal with my cat.

Sebastian is a 1 and a half year old cutie with a mind all his own. He’s the only cat I know who can change the channels on the TV remote and sit around all day watching cartoons.

I was visiting Penticton this weekend so he was home alone. I came home today to find my mouse had been unplugged from my KVM switch and destroyed. He had pulled the various wires out and seperated the cable from the mouse. I was not very happy and he got a good lecture about that.

What is up with that? I mean, seriously, he has a ton of toys from little stuffed mice to a few teddy bears and balls in between and yet, he chooses to attack my computer mouse?

I need to find a cat translator somewhereâ¦..
