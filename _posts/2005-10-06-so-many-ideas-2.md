At the moment, I’ve got so many ideas for new scripts and sites to get out there that it’s hard to know where to begin.

I end up starting a script, getting an idea for another one, working on that one, then stopping and going back to the other one I had started working on. Then sometimes, I just scrap that one and that with a fresh approach again.

At some point, I’ll settle on one idea and keep with it. Probably anyway.
