> Meaningful companies are built upon a strong timeless vision. Lets look at some examples  
>  * To organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful.  Google  
>  * To be the pulse of the planet  Twitter  
>  * To be earths most customer centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.  Amazon
> 
>  These statements may sound abstract and grandiose, but as you begin to think about it, you realise why a plan like To be the Best iPhone Photo App for Sharing Pictures with Facebook Friends or Lets Build Stuff and See What Happens, Right? just wont cut it.
