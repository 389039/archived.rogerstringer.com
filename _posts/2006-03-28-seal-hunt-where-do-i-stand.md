This is probably going to turn into some big thing that will get me totally spammed, but I have to make a comment here about the seal hunt.

The seal hunt has been a strong thing in Newfoundland every year for a lot of years. It’s seen tragedy, and setbacks. It has a strong history and also serves a purpose.

The seal hunt has been around for over a hundred years. It’s been used to help fishermen make a living during the winter and also to help keep the seal population down. Overpopulation of seals means underpopulation of fish stock which hurts fishermen trying to survive. This has been a repeating cycle that the protesters tend to forget about.![Seal Hunters on the Ice](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/008_sealers.jpg)

One of the biggest tragedies related to the seal hunt happened in 1914,when 78 fisherman spent 53 hours stuck on the during a harsh blizzard. They got seperated from their ship following a pack of seals and were stuck in the middle of the ice surrounded by snow and howling winds. There were no survivors. A book was written about it back in the 70s called “Death On the Iceâ which is actually required reading for Newfoundland children. There was also a condensed poem of sorts written about it:

> **Death On The Ice (The Story)**
> 
>  In the spring of nineteen fourteen, the sealers came to town,  
>  Trying to book a passage on a ship iceward bound;  
>  To try and earn a dollar when none was being made,  
>  They would risk life and limb but they were not afraid.
> 
> There was the Bonaventure and the Belleventure, too,  
>  And there was the Newfoundland just waiting for her crew;  
>  There stood the Stephano, what a great ship was she,  
>  And also the Florazelle, a part of this tragedy.
> 
> They came from every bay and town, they came both young and old,  
>  They came not for the sport, but came for a little gold;  
>  Maybe if they were lucky, make a hundred or more,  
>  But would they be so eager if they knew what was in store.
> 
> Now when they made it to the front the Newfoundland got froze,  
>  She found it hard to maneuver in the heavy ice flows;  
>  Her captain was frustrated, the seals were very scarce,  
>  He never seen it quite so bad, the ice was mighty fierce.
> 
> He spotted the Stephano about five miles away,  
>  They were in the main patch and really making it pay;  
>  Then the captain took a chance, sent his men across the ice,  
>  To try and pan some whitecoats but couldn’t foresee the price.
> 
> When they reached the Stephano they were hungry and beat,  
>  So captain Kean took them aboard gave them a bite to eat;  
>  Then he put them on the ice to head for the Newfoundland,  
>  By this time a storm was brewing, and death was close at hand.
> 
> They started for the Newfoundland but soon they were lost,  
>  A blizzard now blew fiercely, they’d soon pay the cost;  
>  More than a hundred thirty men were stranded on the ice,  
>  No one knew that they were there, they’d pay an awful price.
> 
> For two days and two nights they suffered on the flows,  
>  With little shelter and little food, in soaking wet clothes;  
>  When the temperature dropped down, their bodies turned to ice,  
>  Seventy-seven men then perished, they paid the ultimate price.
> 
> They tried to keep on moving so they would not freeze,  
>  Some died while walking, some died on their knees;  
>  Some grew so weary that they no longer cared,  
>  Some walked out in the water and soon disappeared.
> 
> The second day they found them, oh what an awful sight,  
>  Bodies strewn every where, survivors in a plight;  
>  Frozen hands and frozen feet, frostbitten on the face,  
>  What caused this dreadful tragedy, what caused this awful waste?
> 
> They piled their bodies on the deck several layers high,  
>  Their remains like statues, silhouettes against the sky;  
>  With their gruesome cargo, they headed back to shore,  
>  In a history filled with tragedy, just add one chapter more.
