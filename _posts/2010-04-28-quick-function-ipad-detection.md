Of course, the iPad is a pretty large screen and a fully capable browser, so most websites donÂ’t need to have iPad specific versions of them. But if you need to, you can detect for it with .htaccess


    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*iPad.*$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://ipad.yourdomain.com [R=301]
    


This will redirect iPad users to a URL you specify.
