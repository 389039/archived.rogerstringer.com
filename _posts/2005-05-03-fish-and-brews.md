<span class="Text1">Fish and Brews, this is a traditional dish from back in Newfoundland. It takes a lot of work to make, but when you make it, it’s so good you’ll just want to share it with everybody. **Soaking Time: **6-8 hours **Cooking Time: ** 45 min **Makes: ** 6-8 servings. <span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small"></span><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">**<span style="text-decoration: underline">You need:</span>**</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">1. 4 cakes of hard bread(hardtack)
2. 2 pounds of salt cod
3. 1 cup of salt pork, finely diced
</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small"><span style="text-decoration: underline">**Drawn Butter:**</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">1. ¼ cup of butter
2. 2 medium onions, chopped
3. 2 tablespoons of flour
4. 1 cup of water
</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Drawn Butter Preperation</span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">1. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add chopped onions, and fry gently until it is lightly golden brown and soft, (this will take about 10 minutes.) Do not brown.
2. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and mix it in thoroughly. Remove it from the heat.
3. Gradually, while stirring, add half of the water. You then place it back on the heat and bring it to a boil, you stir it constantly, until it is shiny and smooth.
4. Slowly add the remaining water, or until desired consistency is reached. You then cook over low heat for 2-3 minutes. Serve over the fish and brews.
5. Mix thoroughly until well blended.

<span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: x-small">1. Break each bread into 2 or 3 pieces, and soak for 6-8 hours, or overnight in cold water. (Use lots of water, because the water will be absorbed.)
2. Soak the salt cod in a separate bowl of cold water for 6-8 hours, or overnight. (Change water once of twice if you prefer less salt.)  If using fresh fish, add a teaspoon of salt to the water when cooking.
3. In the morning, change the water on the cod, and simmer gently until it is tender, 5-10 minutes.  Remove from heat and drain. Skin, bone, and flake fish.
4. Place the hard bread in a saucepan with enough water to cover the bread, (use the water in which it is soaked). Heat slowly just until it comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and drain it immediately. Add cooked, flaked fish and mix, keep it hot.
5. Fry the salt pork until it is golden brown and crisp. These ‘scrunchions’ and drawn butter may be poured over the fish and brews mixture when served,
6. Serve it hot.
