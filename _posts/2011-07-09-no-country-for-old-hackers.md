Interesting read….

> Who here would consider themselves an old hacker? Whos here reading this because those words resonated? Some of you, I hope, or this might not make any sense. If youre a web developer, calling yourself an old hacker is kind of ridiculous, in the scope of computer programming as a whole. But, relatively speaking, I think we all know what that means. It means you tested in Mosaic. It means you had the lecture about how there was no upgrade path for IE5/Mac and therefore we were going to have to support it until the end of time. It means youve been guilty of table-based layouts and you had your mind blown by To Hell with Bad Browsers and then again by AJAX. Or maybe it just means you remember the browser wars and found it difficult to trust $ over getElementById.
