Ok, so it’s been a little over a week on Paleo, and a few people have asked how I’m finding it… And I’m happy to report that I’m finding it just fine. At first, I found it a bit difficult to keep away from dairy and gluton products, but you just keep focussing on being healthier and it’s easy.

Mostly the biggest change has been adjusting how you look at food, a couple eggs for breakfast in the morning, a nice salad and protein for lunch, and then a nice dinner later in the evening.

I’ve found [hivelogic’s paleo pancake recipe rocks](http://hivelogic.com/articles/best-paleo-pancake-recipe/)!

And I’ve also found a good image that describes how to look at your plate: ![](http://www.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/plate.jpg)

Keep the above plate in mind, and Paleo is pretty easy.
