Freekrai.net got upgraded Saturday morning without a hitch. The new site has launched nicely.

Also started running ads from casale on [Article Base](http://www.article-base.info) to see if I get any decent returns from there.

Next site to get a new facelift is my travel site. Also considering splitting that site up into two seperate sites with one dedicated to hotel bookings.
