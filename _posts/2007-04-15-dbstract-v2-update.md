Work on version 2 of dbStract has been continuing on schedule, and we are still aiming for the May 1st date for the relaunch. The site has seen a huge restructuring as part of our version 2 overhaul with some features being added that had been planned since our first launch a year ago. This shows some great promise and our beta testers have had some excellent feedback as theyâ€™ve been playing with the new features. Keep watching, as we take you into new territory. :)
