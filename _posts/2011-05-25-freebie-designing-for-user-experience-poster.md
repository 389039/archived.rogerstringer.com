> Mike Finch is a firm believer that UX is a verb- not a noun. Its a process, and he believes that if documented and followed correctly, its a process that anyone can have a reasonable amount of success with. As professionals, we need to shout these solutions from the rooftops- not keep them as guarded secrets. To that end, Mike has outlined his personal process when designing for user experience and made this awesome poster for your office wall.
