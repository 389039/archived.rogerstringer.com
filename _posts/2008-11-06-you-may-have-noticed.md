Ok, so today I started to redo the theme that this blog is using, it definetly lends itself nicely to what I want to do here, and with a few more tweaks, will be right where I want it. Some things I’ve done to the theme, was the original twitter feed to the right was javascript based, so I changed it to use PHP and added a caching method to it so that it only updates every hour.
