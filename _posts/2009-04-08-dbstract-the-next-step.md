For the past month, I’ve been working on getting the next phase of [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com) together, and there are new features and re-vamped features that will be showing up. Some new features to expect in the next couple months with [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com):

- Comment System – comment on each entry
- Improved Form Builder
- Improved Report Builder
- Smart logic on entries. Ranging from who to email right up to redirecting to another form based on their entry.
- More Payment methods (for pro users)
- More documentation on the DBStract API. Plus I have some articles underway for using the API that will be published on [Quickpipe.com](http://www.quickpipe.com)
- Some other features, but they are being kept under wraps for the moment. These should be enough to whet your appetite for now.
