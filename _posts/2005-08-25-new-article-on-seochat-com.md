As some of you know, I also do some freelance writing duties for DevShed.com. This week, a new article was published called “Using RSS Feeds and Mod_rewrite to add Classified Listings on your Website” View it here: [ on SEOChat.com](http://www.seochat.com/c/a/Link-Trading-Help/Using-RSS-Feeds-and-Modrewrite-to-add-Classified-Listings-on-your-Website/) A quick overview of the article as if the name doesn’t say it all is this: “Today we’re going to discuss how to put job listings on your site using RSS feeds. You could easily adapt this script to use any type of RSS feeds, but our target for this article is Craigslist.org.”
