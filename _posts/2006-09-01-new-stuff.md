Hey everyone, It’s been a while since our last post, but I thought it was time to update everybody again. So, first off, we’re in the middle of some restructuring of our main website and offering new services. Our first new service, is [Domain Registration](/services/web-solutions/domain-registration/) Servics. We’re also going to be offering webhosting packages coming up shortly. Also, this week, we’ve launched our newest site, [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com). This site has been in the works since December 2005, and has finally seen the light of day after months of planning and development. Users of this site are able to create virtual databases to store all of their data online. We have free and subscription packages. Also, we will be adding more features to the site as we go, with several new features planned for this month alone.
