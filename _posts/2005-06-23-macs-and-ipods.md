So, I recently got a Mac Mini because a client decided I needed to be able to test their web sites from it so he got one for me to use as a work station at home. Its pretty cool. So much power in a such a tiny little box. The mini stands at a total size of 2 inches high and 6.5 inches by 6.5 inches in width and length. I installed the new Tiger upgrade for their OS and I have to say, its a pretty smooth system. I wont be putting my laptop away anytime soon, but for development purposes, the mac is definitely nice to have. I also recently got an iPod Shuffle. That things gotten used everywhere since I got it. Ive been using an FM transmitter to broadcast it over the radio in the car, nice change to be able to listen to MP3s in the car instead of the radio or a CD. Am I a Mac switcher? No, merely a Mac user. However, that wont stop me from using my mac more and posting about new stuff on there ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
