Lately, I’ve been playing with the [netshops](http://www.360affiliate.com/netshops.php) affiliate system, and it’s been making good returns for me. I have a script running on Need 4 Deals, and it’s been seeing a sale almost every day so far. Which I’ve been enjoying. I haven’t done much with making the site look nicer so far, but will be changing it to a newer template shortly. Possibly something similiar to this design.
