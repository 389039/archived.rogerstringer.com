Lately, I’ve been experimenting with some new ideas and approaches. I built a new framework last month for some rapid PHP development and my first project was a stats system that I am using to record some analytics for a couple sites. When it is ready, the site will be released for others to join, but for now, it is just for myself and a few other colleagues to play with. I’ve gotten the reports working to the point that I can view trends over the past week to see what pages and keywords are getting traffic and which ones are not. This can have a big impact when it comes to affiliate marketing to see which pages of a site work and which ones don’t. I’ve also gotten a few other reports worked in that are pretty unique to analytics sysems, but I’ll wait til the site is done before getting into them all :)
