The past few weeks have seen me busy at work on the scaleborg project which is going to be a scalable grid solution that uses amazon s3 and ec2 to create a nice server farm system. The system will let you add as many servers as you need as you need them. Built on a mixture of php, ruby and python for maximum flexibility. Iâ€™ll have more on that as I get it out of early alpha and into invite beta which will be happening by early November.
