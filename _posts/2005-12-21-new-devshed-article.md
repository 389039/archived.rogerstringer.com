DevShed.com has just published another article written by me. It’s called [“Building a Relational Content Management System In PHP / MySQL”](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Building-a-Relational-Content-Management-System-in-PHP-MySQL/) A quick overview of the article as if the name doesn’t say it all is this: “This article will show you how to build a simple relational content management system. What is a relational CMS you ask? Well, a relational CMS lets you create articles that have child articles. This works similiar to other CMSes which have categories and then articles; we will just combine them together to be more relational.”
