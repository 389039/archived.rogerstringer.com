**Ingredients:**

- 3 large eggs, separated
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 tsp Vanilla extract
- 1 (8-oz) container mascarpone cheese
- 1/2 cup chilled heavy cream (35%)
- 1 cup very strong brewed coffee or brewed espresso, cooled to room temperature
- 1/4 cup Baileys Irish Cream
- 1/4 cup Kahlua
- 24 *savoiardi* (crisp Italian ladyfingers)
- 1/4 cup fine-quality bittersweet chocolate shavings (not unsweetened) or 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

**Directions:**

1. Beat together yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Beat in mascarpone until just combined.
2. Beat whites with a pinch of salt and vanilla in another bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar a little at a time, beating, then continue to beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat cream in another bowl with cleaned beaters until it holds stiff peaks. Fold cream into mascarpone mixture gently but thoroughly, then fold in whites.
3. Stir together coffee and liqueurs in a shallow bowl. Dip 1 ladyfinger in coffee mixture, soaking it about 4 seconds on each side, and transfer to an 8-inch glass baking dish (2-quart capacity). Repeat with 8 more ladyfingers and arrange in bottom of dish, trimming as needed to fit snugly. Spread half of mascarpone mixture evenly over ladyfingers. Make another layer in same manner with remaining ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture. Chill tiramisu, covered, at least 6 hours. For best results, prepare 24 hours before consuming.
4. If youre feeling adventurous, you can layer this in a large martini glass it makes for a wonderful presentation (my favorite)
5. Just before serving, sprinkle with chocolate or cocoa. Icing sugar, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, mint, and fanned strawberries make for an elegant presentation for this dish. Tiramisu doesnt keep forever, so make sure you eat this within a day or two. Though you probably wont have a problem once you try this.
