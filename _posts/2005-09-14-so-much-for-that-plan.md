Ok, so I haven’t posted much since the new shift started 14 days ago. It took some getting used to, but now I have gotten used to it.

Been busy with various scripting projects lately and also trying some new stuff.

I wrote an XML-RPC server/client system that I store all my sites in, then when I want to display links on one page, I simply call the XML-RPC client and have it return sites under the category I am in. This helps keep all my shopping sites current, as well as all my other sites current.

Also been busy on a new CMS which I’ll be using to replace the existing CMS on freekrai.net very shortly.

Basically, been busy.
