> [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com/) is a new JavaScript framework that was formerly SproutCore 2.0. When I tried out SproutCore for the first time a few years ago, I was impressed with its data binding and templates, but I found it included a lot of things I didnt need or want, like a large UI framework and its own recommended toolchain and workflow. I wished I could just use the few core parts of SproutCore easily and leave out the rest. Ember.js is that wish coming true. Its main focuses are: data binding, computed properties, and auto-updating templates.
