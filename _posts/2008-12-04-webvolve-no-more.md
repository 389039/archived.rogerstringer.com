Ok, so after a lot of thinking, I made the decision yesterday to desolve webvolve. Webvolve has spent the last 7 years as a cooking site, but for the past 3 or so years, I had just let it sit there, and hadn’t been keeping as on top of updates as I should have been. This lead to the site simply sitting there, drawing in traffic and then driving people away. So I decided to do the right thing and move the recipes over here to my blog. I’m planning a new recipe site in the new year, but that will have a slightly different style and tone to it than webvolve had.
