<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5"><tr><td valign="top"> So, the car you can see to my right, is my brand new 2007 Dodge Caliber. It’s a Steel Blue SXT model with a 2.0 litre engine and a CVT transmission. Fully loaded speakers and a 6 CD changer to boot. It’s a fun car to drive to work and back every day ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)  
 Looking forward to some road trips with this one. ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
