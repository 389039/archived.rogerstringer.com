Interesting linkâ€¦

> It is great if working from different computers or just as a backup utility. The best part is the unlimited repositories and collaborators. Just share the folder with the people you want as collaborators and they can easily clone and push. You also can setup to receive notifications on changes made on Dropbox. It is like Github but free.
