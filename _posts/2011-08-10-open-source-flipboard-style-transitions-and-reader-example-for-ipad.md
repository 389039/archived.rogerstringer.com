> Previously I posted about creating a magazine style text reader using Core Text. From the response to that article I can see that there is a good amount of interest in building reading apps on the iPad. The Flipboard app is an excellent magazine style reader for iPad. With the beautiful middle of the page flipping, and easy to read articles setup really gives it an immersive quality.
