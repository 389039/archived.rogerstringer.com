Since yesterday, newsPage has gone from version 1.0 to 1.01 to 1.0.1b to 1.1 and now today it is 1.2 It has seen quite a few changes and additions, including the ability to create topics and the ability to do more customizing in the settings area. Some changes:

- Choose whether to use the newsPage CSS file or your theme’s CSS
- Assign keywords to each feed to act as a topic (basically, a tag), you can then display feeds on a page based on that topic.
- Choose to use the feed’s title, or the title you specify.
- And several minor fixes throughout the script. Thanks to all who provided feedback and ideas, and let’s keep the ideas coming :)
