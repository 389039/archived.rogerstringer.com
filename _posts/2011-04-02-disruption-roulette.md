A fun little game for entrepreneurs You will need the following:  
 * 1 White board  
 * 1 Computer with Internet connection  
 * 1 Yellow Pages

1. Simply take the phone book and throw it up in the air.
2. Whatever section it lands on, create a disruptive business model and build a minimum viable product.

*Any industry that still fills the yellow pages with paid advertisements is begging to be disrupted with a post-internet business model.*
