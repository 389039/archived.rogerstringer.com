Last night, I rolled out the new design for this blog, as well, last week, I relaunched [quickpipe.com](http://www.quickpipe.com) with a new design. On top of that, last week also saw the silent launch of [wphive.com](http://www.wphive.com), which is a wordpress site that allows for thumbs up, thumbs down of articles. One of the interesting things about working on wphive, was that I decided to use absolutely no plugins for the submissions and voting areas, all of it was custom coded to be handled inside the theme itself, and was fun to write.
