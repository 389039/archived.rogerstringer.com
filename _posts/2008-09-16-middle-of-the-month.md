Ok, so I haven’t made any new posts since the first of September, it’s been a pretty busy month between work, projects and getting things ready to take Kaitlyn on her first trip to Newfoundland next week. Both [ActivityPipe.com](http://www.activitypipe.com) and [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com) have been seeing a lot of traffic lately, which is good. A few people making use of the ActivityPipe plugin to display their Activity Streams via wordpress. And for DBStract, lots of people are finding uses for collecting data online. Working to finish off aslifeis this week before we take our trip. And working out the plan for a new project tracking site that is built off some scripts I implemented a while back for doing project management for myself. But more about that project as time goes.
