True words….

> I wonder if Jerry ever got jealous of acts that were able to put songs on the radio. (The Dead had exactly one hit record…) I hope not. Jerry was in a different business. Sure, he played music. Elton John also plays music. But they were in different businesses, performing for different audiences, generating revenue in different ways, creating different sorts of art.
