As I previously posted, I was away all last week, vacationing with my wife and daughter. Now, I am back and I am getting some projects done. Friendz is almost finished, mostly what is left is documentation, and that will be getting finished up over this weekend. Surveyti.me is also almost ready to launch, it is a quick free survey builder that lets you create fast surveys to add to your websites. Just a few more tweaks left to do and I’ll be talking more about it’s launch. [Foodizu.com](http://www.foodizu.com) is enjoying growing it’s recipe base and there will be new recipes getting added very shortly. Finally, [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com) will be seeing some new additions to it’s report builder in the next couple weeks, followed by a newly redesigned backend area.
