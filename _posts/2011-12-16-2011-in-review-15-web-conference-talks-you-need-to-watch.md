> **Technology conferences increasingly release videos of their presentations online. Simon Willison, the co-founder and CEO of Lanyrd, presents 15 of the best of 2011** We started Lanyrd in 2010 to help people keep track of all of the great conferences and events happening around the world, and to encourage people to help build a permanent archive of the slides, video and audio produced by the events. Our community added nearly 3,000 videos to the site in 2011  I’ve used our data to pick out 15 talks that best illustrate this year’s hottest topics in web design and development. The presentations here span topics from mobile first development to web operations, social graph analysis, web typography, entrepreneurship and more.
