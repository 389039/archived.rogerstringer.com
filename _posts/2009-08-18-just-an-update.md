I know that the blog updates have been a little slack this month, I was on vacation with my wife and daughter and then had to play catch up once I got back. So far, August has been a busy month. Got some new updates for [DBStract](http://www.dbstract.com) currently with some beta testers, and will be rolling them out shortly, as well, [surveyti.me](http://www.surveyti.me) and [foodizu](http://www.foodizu.com) will both see some new features coming shortly. Otherwise, there hasnâ€™t been a lot else to report, just been working a lot.
