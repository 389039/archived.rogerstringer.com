Since I was doing so much playing around with Amazon’s Product Advertising API to make changes for my proASM and my ASM2 script that I started making some new Amazon powered sites for the heck of it. Deciding to do it differently, I took the SOAP route rather than the usual REST route a whole new Amazon script from scratch. The two I’ve made so far are: [http://www.netbookcentral.info](http://www.netbookcentral.info) and [mobile-phone-cases.info](http://www.mobile-phone-cases.info). Also differently, was how I decided to change the URL structure as well as having some meta tags dynamically generated by the product display. How these will do I’ll wait and see.
