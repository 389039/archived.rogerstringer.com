 2. Arrange the cod portions on the base of the dish.  
 3. Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the onions and fry gently for 4-5 minutes until slightly softened. Remove the onions with a spoon and place on top of the fish. Cook the mushrooms in the same way.  
 4. Meanwhile bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the diced green pepper and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and add to the fish, followed by the mushrooms. Top with the tomato slices, generously sprinkled with salt and pepper.  
 5. Combine the cheese and breadcrumbs in a bowl, mix well, then sprinkle over the fish and vegetables.  
 6. Bake for 30 minutes.  
 7. Serve at once.
