Ok, I know it’s been a while since my last posting, things have been pretty busy over here.

First of all, projects are keeping me busy right now. I’ve got two new fairly large sites about to launch as well as the fact that I am restructuring my entire business to change it’s focus.

Aside from that, the Caliber is running sweet and is a nice car. We’ve had it on a couple roadtrips so far and it’s been a nice ride each time.
