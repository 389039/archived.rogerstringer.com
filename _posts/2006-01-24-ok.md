Ok, I’m really slacking on these posts.  
 Trying to do at least 2 a week, and it’s been pretty slow going the last few weeks.

Not a whole lot to report. Been working on a few website ideas to add to my ever growing network. I think I’m gonna set up a classifieds site as my next project. Something that is free to use and can draw in traffic pretty well is what I am thinking.

I want to move away from the affiliate networks for a little bit. Also in the process of working on a new travel site similiar to my friendly travel site, but with the ability for people to review hotels as well.
