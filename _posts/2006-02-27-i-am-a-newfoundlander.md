I freely admit it, I’m from Newfoundland. I grew up a Newfie as we call it, and will always be one, even though I now live on the other side of the country and only go home every couple years, it’s still my home.

The following is something that was written by a well-known Newfoundland music group called “Buddy Wasisname & The Other Fellersâ, and it’s something that’s true with just about every Newfie living away:

> Hey
> 
> I’m not on pogey, and I’m not married to my sister.
> 
> I don’t eat codfish tree times a day, ah well, that’s cause dere ain’t no more codfish left.
> 
> I don’t own a boat or a sou’wester but I can see a boat from me window.
> 
> I don’t drink screech, at least not before noon on a weekday anyways.
> 
> I don’t know Gordon Pinscent or Mary Walsh or Jimmy Flynn or Rick Mercer, but I watch dis hour has 22 minutes every week eh.
> 
> I got a Premier named Brian Tobin, he went to war against spain over somethin’ called a turbot.
> 
> I’m not sure what a turbot is actually but I’m damned if I’m going to any guy from spain take him away from me.
> 
> I ain’t de b’y that builds the boats and I ain’t the b’y that sails em, but like I said before I can see a boat from my window, eh.
> 
> I don’t dance a jig everytime I hear celtic music, but I’ll do dat kareoke ting if I got enough blackhorse beers in me.
> 
> I’m still pissed off at Prince Edward Island for buildin’ dat dere bridge and not buildin’ one out to the rock, dem stupid spudheads.
> 
> And even though he ain’t really a newfie I think stompin’ tom connors should run for Prime Minister.
> 
> Newfoundland is the oldest settlement in North America, and the youngest province in confederation – oh, my grandfather’s still pissed  
>  off about dat one, you don’t even wanna talk about Joey Smallwood to Grandpa.
> 
> And even tho I lives in Fort McMurray, Lord thunderin’ Jesus I still tinks that Newfoundland is the best damn province the country.
> 
> My name is Buddy and I is a Newfoundlander!
