Interesting reading from 37Signals

> Does the minimum-viable approach lead to gaps in the user experience? It doesnt have to. Theres a distinction to make: The set of features you choose to build is one thing. The level you choose to execute at is another. You can decide whether or not to include a feature like reset password. But if you decide to do it, you should live up to a basic standard of execution on the experience side.
