Over the weekend, I decided to consolidate my sites. I had been using mediatemple’s grid server since April but it was just having too many latency issues that made for a less enjoable experience. I decided to move to a VPS on slicehost where I have had an account for a while. The move was fairly smooth, but server migrations are something I’ve been doing for 10 years so they generally are. Overall, I’m preferring slicehost over mediatemple and can see staying there for a while to come.
