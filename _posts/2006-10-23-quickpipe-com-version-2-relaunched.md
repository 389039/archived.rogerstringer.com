So, last week, I relaunched my main article site [QuickPipe.com](http://www.quickpipe.com)

The site’s been relaunched with a new design and a new CMS. I’m slowly restoring the previously stored articles to the database, since it included a new database so some articles were not copied over yet. Some won’t be either.

Next, I plan to get some new content written for it. Which I will be doing shortly.
