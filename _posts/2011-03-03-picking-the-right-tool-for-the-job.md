I’ve been coding since I got my first Color Computer 3 in the 3rd grade, and I love it. I’ve been coding professionally since 1997, working on embedded security systems using C++, Java and Delphi (yes, I was one of those people who worked with Delphi).

One thing I’ve learned over the years is to always go with the right tool for the job. I’ve worked with C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Cold Fusion, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Objective-C, Javascript (starting back before there were frameworks like jQuery and mootools).

I’ve used Databases ranging from CouchDB, MySQL, PostGreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and Borland Interbase, Simple DB, and BigTable. This isn’t about what I’ve done over the years though, it’s about learning to always pick the right tool…

Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of app development for mobile systems like smartphones and tablets. Originally, I was big on using x-code for all iOS work, but as I’ve started to look more towards cross-platform development where you build an app once, and it gets compiled for the platform needed, specifically iOS and Android.

Titanium Appcelerator is the tool I’ve found handy for this. You develop in a javascript based system, that even has support for databases, camera, GPS, etc and then you compile for the platform you choose.

It’s handy, and development time has been actually cut in half. Another nice thing, unlike the other alternative of PhoneGap, your apps built in Appcelerator actually get compiled natively for the platform you’re working on. Android gets a Java project and compiling for iOS gets an x-code project.

You’ll be hearing about a few projects being released shortly on here that were built in Appcelerator, so keep your ears on as they say.
