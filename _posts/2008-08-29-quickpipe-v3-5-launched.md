So, this week has been a busy blogging wise, I moved 3 blogs into one (this blog), and I moved [QuickPipe.com](http://www.quickpipe.com) onto a new system. I kept the job board, and all the articles are getting touch ups for the new template which is based on the same one this site is running, but with some changes. Actually, quite a few differences, and still some things left to do to it before the weekend is out.
