We never use a screwdriver in the last week. We hammer the screws in. We slam solder on the connections, cannibalize parts from other televisions if we run out of the right ones, use glue or hammers to fix switches that were never meant for that model. All the time management is pressing us to work faster, to make the target so we all get our bonuses. Worker in a Soviet television factory quoted in Milgrom & Roberts: Economics, Organization and Management.
