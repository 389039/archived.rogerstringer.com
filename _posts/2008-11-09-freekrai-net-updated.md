[Freekrai.net](http://www.freekrai.net), my main business website got a big update done today, and part of that update involved moving it from th VPS it had been on for the past 2 years, to hosting it on my main dedicated server. On the frontend, I changed the look, then redid the content, some pages are still getting rewritten, and some have been removed. Some new services are being offered, and some old services got removed as I stopped offerring them. I also made mention of a new product that is about to be launched, which Iâ€™ll post about here when it launches in the next couple weeks. I started redoing this site months ago, and after dozens of design changes, ended up deciding on a design that was actually made by woothemes, with several changes to handle how I wanted it to work.
