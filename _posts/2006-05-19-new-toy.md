<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5"><tr><td valign="top"> So, last night I decided to buy a new toy.I bought a 21 speed mountain bike, but it’s not like the usual 21 speeds, no, not at all. This 21 speed comes with an electric motor that assists during peddling and then can switch to full electric, or you can ride with no electric at all.It’s pretty cool, the motor clicks you along doing around 28 kilometers an hour and it’s pretty comfortable.

 As you can see from the pic on the right, it looks like a normal mountain bike for the most part. Has three modes. Pedal power, pedal assist, and full electric.

 Gotta put a bike computer on it this weekend so I can track how fast it’s actually going and how much traveling I’ve done with it.

 Looking forward to getting some time in this summer on it ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
