Been hard at work on my newest project lately at [ActivityPipe.com](http://www.activitypipe.com "Activity Pipe"), it’s a site that lets you build your own activity streams. You add your various links to it, and it creates a new little activity stream, you can see an example of it [here.](http://www.activitypipe.com/freekrai/) There’s still more to do, and the end result will be a wordpress plugin, as well as a couple other plugins for some other sites, but it’s coming together pretty nicely.
