Today, I’m pleased to announce the launch of [FoodJumper.com](http://www.foodjumper.com). FoodJumper.com is the end result of a month of planning, before even starting down the road of adding recipes and posts. To put it simply, it’s a foodie blog, similar to [foodizu.com](http://foodizu.com), but different in that, this one is just me and also contains posts and videos, etc, whereas foodizu is a community of people adding recipes. Why make another foodie site? Well, to put it simply, because I love food, so why not?
