Today, I launched the new design of this blog. It’s been in the works for the past month and a half.Trying to get all the various ideas together in one place. I started off with a theme I bought from themeforest, and moved from there to change it to have the look and feel I was most comfortable with. The end result is one I’m pretty pleased with.
