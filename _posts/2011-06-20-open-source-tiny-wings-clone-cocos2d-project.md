Interesting to play around withâ€¦

> I just found out about an interesting open source MIT licensed project that aims to create a game similar to Tiny Wings. The project is from Sergey Tikhonov, and while it is not 100% complete there is still quite a bit that can be learned about developing with Cocos2D and Box2D from the project.
