So, I’m getting ready to launch a couple new Amazon sites. These will run alongside the ones I already have and also have some new features.

I’m trying some new things for my sites, like RSS feeds from other related sites, etc to help boost visitors and traffic. I’ll just have to wait and see how it all goes.
