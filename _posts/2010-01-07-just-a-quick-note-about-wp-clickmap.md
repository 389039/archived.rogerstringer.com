[WP-Clickmap](http://www.rogerstringer.com/projects/wpclickmap) has gotten a minor update today to allow it to install in wordpress 2.9. Over the next few months or so, I’ve got some new features planned for that plugin, and will be adding it to the wordpress depository once I’m done with the upgrades.
