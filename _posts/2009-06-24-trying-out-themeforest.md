Last week, ThemeForest introduced 2 new categories Javascript and PHP Scripts. I thought about it and figured why not, so I added 4 scripts to the marketplace (3 to PHP, 1 to javascript).

The new javascript google chart library has been picking up in sales, so far themeforest is working well for script sales.
