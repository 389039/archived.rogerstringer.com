Getting closer to the full releaseâ€¦

> WordPress 3.2 Release Candidate 2 is now ready for testing. Andrew Nacin posted the update to the WordPress news blog, along with an update on what has happened since Release Candidate 1. In the last ten days tweaks have been made to Twenty Eleven (the new default theme) and various RTL fixes. Nacin recommends that theme and plugin authors should be testing their work by now so that compatibility issues can be caught before the public release.
