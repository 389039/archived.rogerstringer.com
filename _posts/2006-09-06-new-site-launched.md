<span class="newsarticle">Hey everyone, I thought I’d make it public that my latest project is now launched.</span>

[DBStract.com](http://www.dbstract.com/) – This site has been in the works since December 2005, and has finally seen the light of day after months of planning and development. Users of this site are able to create virtual databases to store all of their data online. I have free and subscription packages. Also, I will be adding more features to the site as I go, with several new features planned for this month alone.
