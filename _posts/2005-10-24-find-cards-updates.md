I upgraded my credit card web site at [www.find-cards.com](http://www.find-cards.com/) over the weekend. New design, new schema, new site. Much faster than the previous one.

I also set up the search script to work with [freekrai.net](http://www.freekrai.net) the weekend, but I haven’t made the link available to people yet. Will be doing that shortly.

Other than that, spent the weekend doing some work for clients and getting the girlfriend’s house ready for winter. Helping out down there kind of makes up for the fact that there are people who get paid to get my house ready for winter.

Also, I’m planning on adding a new section to this blog. I’m gonna set up a recipe category since I also run a cooking site and am a chef. You’ll see some recipes show up very shortly.
