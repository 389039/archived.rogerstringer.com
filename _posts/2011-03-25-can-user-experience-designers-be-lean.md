> When I asked Jared Spool (whom I met at [Dave McLures](http://500hats.typepad.com/) Warm Gun[conference](http://www.warmgun.com/)) why so few UX researchers join early stage startups, he replied (a bit tongue in cheek): <q>Startups are run by entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs know everything. They dont listen. A UX researcher would be frustrated.</q> That made me wonder is there a class of startups where the entrepreneurs*are* eager to listen? and how could UX researchers be valuable in a startup?
