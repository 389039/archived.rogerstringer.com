So, it’s now 2006, I know it’s been 2 weeks since my last post. That always seems to happen around the holidays where I tend to get behind on posting.

Things are a bit hectic right now. Dealing with money issues, projects, work, everything. I think it always tends to come running around this time of year.

I need to get some new scripts done for the end of the month to put up for sale. Just not sure where to start.
