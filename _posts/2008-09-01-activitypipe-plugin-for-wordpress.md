I just finished working on the [activitypipe.com](http://www.activitypipe.com) plugin for wordpress which makes a pretty nice looking lifestream page powered from activitypipe.com. You can take a look at the page [here](http://www.rogerstringer.com/lifestream/) Iâ€™ve also made the plugin available for download to activitypipe users.
