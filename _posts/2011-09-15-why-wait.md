True words from Seth Godin….

> Why wait? Who cares when it’s due? If you’re on the critical path, if someone is waiting for your contribution, ship now. We have deadlines for a reason, but the key word is ‘dead’. In fact, you don’t have to wait for the deadline or get anywhere near it, especially if you want to speed things up.
