I never liked the term customer service. Its become a buzzword that describes any type of customer communication. Im all for the concept, and companies like Zappos are an inspiration to anyone looking to build a customer-driven community. One of the major points in customer service today is that you dont always get your way. If you called Zappos and asked for a pair of shoes to be sent to your house free of charge, theyd probably politely refuse.
