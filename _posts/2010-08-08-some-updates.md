It’s been a busy summer, so I realize posts haven’t been happening much lately. I’m working on a lot of changes for this site, which will be happening shortly, as well as a few announcements related to some new projects I’m involved in, so stay tuned. On another note, wordcamp Kelowna is shaping up nicely for September 11th, just a little more than a month away, and I’ll be saying more about that on here too as the time approaches.
