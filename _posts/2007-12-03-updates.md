I know it’s been a while since I’ve done an update on here, but that will change very shortly.

Things have been pretty busy lately working quite a bit, getting some new projects finished, complete with a new Javascript library for my own sites and also getting used to soon becoming a new dad.

Overall, lots of changes happening ![:)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
