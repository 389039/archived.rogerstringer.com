For the past week, my wife and I have been enjoying showing our daughter around Banff and Calgary. We’ve taken our 14 month old for her first visit to the zoo, her first swim in a pool, her first (and second and third) ice cream at Cows and her first gondolla ride. It’s been fun, and I’ve also been using the time to draw up ideas. Ideas for some new sites, ideas for existing sites and ideas for where to put my focus for the next half of 2009. Once we get home, I’ll have some more updates about these ideas, but suffice it to say they should be fun.
