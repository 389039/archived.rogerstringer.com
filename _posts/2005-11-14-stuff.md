Ok, I made a few more tweaks to this design over the past week to get it just the way I like it. That is now done.

Spent some time on a few various projects over the weekend. Did some more work on the new cooking site, and started working on my new mac site.

Iâ€™ve partnered with a colo facility in the states to sell colo space geared towards macs. Should be an interesting project there.
