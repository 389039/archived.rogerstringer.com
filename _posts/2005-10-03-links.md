So, a couple weeks ago, I wrote about a new XML-RPC system I wrote that lets me set up links pages easily on my sites.

I’ve now got all my sites properly set up with the links client and they are working nicely. It’s a pretty cool piece of technology that I plan to play with some more later. Maybe set it to return links in a random order or something like that.
