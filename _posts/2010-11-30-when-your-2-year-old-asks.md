Lessons learned as a dad so far:

- When your 2 year old asks if she can put the new TV she and her mom bought you as an early christmas present in her room… *You say when you’re 10 years old.*
- When your 2 year old asks if she can watch a movie on her iPod touch in bed…* You say it’s charging.*
- When your 2 year old points out that the iPod is in her hands and therefore not charging…*You take it away and charge it.*
- When your 2 year old asks you to make snowmen… *You ask where her scarf is.*
- When your 2 year old wants to bake a cake…*You let her help you out.*
- When your 2 year old asks to go for ice cream… *You grab your keys.*
- When your 2 year old wants a song at bedtime… *You ask what song.*
- When your 2 year old asks if she can have your old iPhone when you get a new one… *You just stare at her.*

Basically, this list can go on forever, but essentially, you get the idea. This is just a short example of what’s been learned so far.
