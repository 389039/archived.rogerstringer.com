Two new sites launched this week.

First Site:

[123 Send It](http://www.123-send-it.com), this site is designed as a sort of sister site to my image hosting site. People can upload files up to 2 megabytes in size and send the download link to friends. Friends receive the link in the email, download the file and that is that.

Second Site:

[Affiliate Developer](http://www.affiliate-developer.com), this site is still in progress, but it’s primary purpose is to serve as a home to my affiliate scripts and the forum. I upgraded the version of the forum it is running and once I get time, I’ll change the template on the forum to match with the rest of the site.
