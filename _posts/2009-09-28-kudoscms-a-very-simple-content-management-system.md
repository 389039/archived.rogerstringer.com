Over the years, as I’ve built sites for clients, they’ve always wanted to edit just certain parts of the page. So as early as 7 years ago, I began using a simple CMS that has grown in ability and ease of use as I’ve done projects for clients. Today, I’m releasing the newest version of this CMS, which has been branded [KudosCMS](http://www.kudoscms.com). KudosCMS is simply a very simple Content Management System, you add elements to your webpages and editors can then edit those elements.

<div style="text-align:center">![sample](http://www.rogerstringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sample.jpg)</div>This image pretty much shows how you add KudosCMS to your web pages. Again, useful for when you only want to edit certain pages, or edit certain parts of a page. Or when you have clients who want to edit content without changing the rest of the site, and don’t need a large Content Management System. Oh yeah, and to celebrate the launch of this new CMS, I’ve set up that you can get $10.00 off if you use the coupon code “twitter” :)
