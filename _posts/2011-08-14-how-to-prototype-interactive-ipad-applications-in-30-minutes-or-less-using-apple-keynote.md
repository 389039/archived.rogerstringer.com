Interesting way for doing quick interactive iPad mockups…

> How long does it usually take to go from idea to creating a prototype that you can test with users? A month? A week? Few days? How about 30 minutes? What if you can prototype your next idea quickly and cheaply without using any special wireframing or design tools? What if you can send your prototype to friends to play with and give you feedback, without having to worry about uploading it to a server or making sure they have the right platform? What if you can embed your prototype within your product presentation, and click through it to show your audience how it works, rather than overloading their imagination with bullet points? And what if you can do all this without writing a single line of code? The challenge with existing prototyping tools is that they require you to become a designer in order to create a good looking, interactive prototype. By taking design out prototyping, you can focus on simply placing components on a page, editing their text, and create links between components and other pages. And contrary to popular beliefs, a prototype doesnt need to look ugly or rough, especially if youre presenting it to a prospective client or investor.
