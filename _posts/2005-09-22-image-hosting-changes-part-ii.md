Yesterday, I mentioned that I was doing some changes on my image hosting site, [123 Image Hosting](http://www.123-image-hosting.info/), last night, I gave the site a nice new face lift. Much better than the previous design that it had and began getting some new features laid out that I want to add to it.

Iâ€™m planning on getting to work now to get this site up there in the search engines pretty quickly. This site gets good traffic already and I want to double that as soon as I can.
