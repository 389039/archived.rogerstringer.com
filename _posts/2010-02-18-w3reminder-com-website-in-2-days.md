This week, as part of the [twilio.com](http://twilio.com) SMS contest, I decided to quickly whip up a [reminder service](http://www.w3reminder.com) that would send your phone a text when you told it to. Even without the contest, I would have done it anyway, but it just provided a good incentive to do it now. Once you sign up, you have two ways of setting reminders, either from your account, or from your phone by sending a text message in the appropriate format. There’s still a little work to do, but it’s been sending me proper reminders for a couple days so that works for me :)
