One new and cool feature we’ve added to dbStract is a field type called “Link to Entry”. This lets you create a database, and in that database create a table called products (or whatever name you want to use), then you can create another table called bug tracker and in bug tracker, you can have a field that is linked to products. Then when you enter new entries into bug tracker, you can choose what product the bug is for. We’ve also added a field type called “Workgroup Users”, this lets you have a dropdown list that is populated with users from your workgroup (for people with an account that can have more than one user). These new features are helping shape dbStract into a lean, mean, database machine.
