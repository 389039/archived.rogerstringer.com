Ok, so if you’re seeing this, then the site is now live on it’s new server. I made up my mind recently to move more of my sites onto my mediatemple account, since I want to keep my sites grouped together, blogs on one server, other sites on another server, etc. It was a bit of a rocky start as mediatemple had some issues at the same time, but it seems to be fine now. Will give it a couple days before I start to move the others over.
