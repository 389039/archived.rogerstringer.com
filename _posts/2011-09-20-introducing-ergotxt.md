[ErgoTxt](http://rogerstringer.com/ergotxt/) is a mashup I built over the past week that works well for office workers.. Being an office worker myself, sometimes I can spend hours in one place. Leveraging the handy [ErgoBot](http://twitter.com/ErgoBot) on twitter and Twilio’s handy SMS API, I built ErgoTxt every hour it sends registered users a text message to tell them to do something. These messages are generated by ErgoBot and sent straight to you, so you can get reminded to get up and do something.
