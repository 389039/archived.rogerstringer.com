This has been an exciting week for [TheInterviewr.com](http://theinterviewr.com), it got picked up by some popular websites and gained some interest out on the web. Some of the sites that have featured TheInterviewr.com:

- [Lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/5833998/theinterviewr-records-schedules-your-interviews-and-other-phone-calls "TheInterviewr Records, Schedules Your Interviews and Other Phone Calls"): **TheInterviewr Records, Schedules Your Interviews and Other Phone Calls**

> There are a few ways of recording phone callsSkype, a third-party jailbreak app on your iPhone, a digital voice recorder with a headphone adapter, incoming Google Voice callsbut none have been as easy as using TheInterviewr. The webapp lets you schedule interviews, upload documents you’ll use for that interview, and best of all, record it automatically.

> TheInterviewr is a new mashup that makes it super, super simple to record telephone interviews online using your existing telephone. It is a dream come true and for now at least – it’s free.

Since Tuesday night, I’ve seen over 400 new users, and have handled over 200 interviews.  And from conversations with users, I’ve also begun fleshing out the next version of the site, which will have more features for users to use.
