In my last post, I mentioned the idea of putting some recipes on this blog.

That idea changed to me deciding that my current cooking site had kind of reached it’s limit and it was time to start fresh.

I grabbed a good domain name that I could use and I plan to set that up shortly as a new cooking site. It will have a blog-like feel to it, but it will be written using my new CMS (the one I have running freekrai.net at the moment). Easy to make some quick modifications to it to make it have RSS feeds, etc.

I plan to move all my old recipes over to it, plus lots of new ones.

I’ll let you guys know the name of it very shortly ![;)](http://www.tydeontheweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)
