> Long time Apple devotee Sinbad delivered a very funny keynote address this afternoon at Macworld, talking for about 20 minutes and then taking questions from the audience. He has been coming to Macworld since 1991 and talked about everything from his first Mac, which was a Macintosh 512K that he said had so little memory that putting in his password maxed it outâ€¦. Of note, is the last paragraph when he mentions his favourite apps, and 1stvideo made by a local company here in Kelowna called Vericorder is his top pick.
