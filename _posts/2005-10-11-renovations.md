Ok, so I just finished getting everything in place so that one day this week I’ll be upgrading freekrai.net to go with the new design and CMS. Just making sure everything is moved over to the new site first.

Also getting ready to redesign a couple more of my sites that just turned 1 years old. My travel site, http://www.friendly-travel.info and my credit card site http://www.find-cards.com, but of these sites have made me money and will be getting facelifts shortly.

Other than that, getting a couple new scripts finished to launch and working on some new Amazon sites.
