I know, I wanted to finish v3 before now, but in the middle of the redesign, our daughter was born, so I took some time off for that. Now, I am back to work on dbStract v3, and it is shaping up nicely. The system is coming together quickly, and there are only a couple things left to do before I take it out of beta. In the meantime, we’ve got more and more people signing up for dbStract, so I’ll be sending out invites for them to check out the beta of v3 sometime in the next couple weeks.
