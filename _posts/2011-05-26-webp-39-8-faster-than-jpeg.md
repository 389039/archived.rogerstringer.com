Just spreading the word….

> Google has used their insanely smart engineers to create an image compression algorithm thats just as good as JPEG but 39.8% smaller. Its called WebP and its pronounced weppy. You can create WebP images in Acorn, Pixelmator, ImageMagick, Leptonica and XnConvert. If you use Photoshop, you can also install the WebP plugin.
