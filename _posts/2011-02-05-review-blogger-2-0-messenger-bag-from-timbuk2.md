Recently, I gave in and ordered a Blogger 2.0 Messenger bag from [TimBuk2.com](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/laptop/laptop-messenger-style/blogger2.0). I chose this model because it’s handy for traveling, the laptop pocket has a seperate access on the back of the bag, while the front has enough pockets for handling iPad, camera, other gadgets, even clothes, etc.

So far, here’s what I’ve found..

**Size:** This bag is just right for carrying around up to a 15 inch MacBook Pro in the back pocket, and an iPad and other gadgets in the front pockets. I usually carry either a 13 inch MacBook Air or a 13 inch MacBook Pro in the laptop pocket on the back.

**Comfort:** The bag has a nice padded, easy to adjust shoulder strap, but I tend to not use it.With or without it, the bag is comfortable to wear. It is also very easy to carry by the handle.

**Organization:** I have never been disappointed with the organization factors in a Timbuk2 bag and this one did not let me down. Tons of pockets and organization spaces, pockets that are easy to access without removing the bag from my shoulder or completely bringing up the front flap, a separate compartment for the laptop, etc. Cant say enough about the awesome organization in this bag.

**Other factors:** I love that this bag has water bottle pockets. No longer must I use the clips that hold down the flap to connect my bottle to the bag to carry it. Definitely a plus that the bag is TSA approved so no need to remove your laptop when going through airport security. Just open the back laptop area and put the bag on the belt. Sweet! Just like any other messenger style bag, dont overload this one if you want your shoulders to be happy. If youre looking for an every day bag as a student or a professional, I would definitely recommend it as long as you dont intend on trying to carry a lot of books plus a laptop.
