The last couple days have been spent doing some updates to the user interface for [dbStract.com](http://www.dbstract.com). Weâ€™ve moved from using open source javascript libraries to using our own in-house library, which means a few areas of dbStract has been redone. Our form validation now uses our library, as well as several other areas. In the next month or so, we will be getting more features added as well, complete with a whole new suite of tools to use for embedding your databases onto your website seamlessly :) Basically, gonna be a fun 2008.
