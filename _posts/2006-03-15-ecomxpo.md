I thought I’d mention quickly that the eComXpo is coming up on April 4-6, 2006 and they have allowed free registration to take part here:  
[http://www.ecomxpo.com/freepass01](http://www.ecomxpo.com/freepass01).

eComXpo is a virtaul tradeshow for ecommerce marketers, and I’ve gone to the last couple of these shows and have made some good contacts there from both presenters as well as fellow tradeshow visitors so I thought I’d pass this link on to everyone else.
