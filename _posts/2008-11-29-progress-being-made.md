Ok, so for the past couple months, I’ve been busy on my project management site. This will be a new site that anyone can use for free to track projects. It’s mostly there, just a couple content changes to make and it will be ready for launch. I will be launching by the end of the year. Should be pretty interesting as I used a lot of new ideas and design styles for this site, and yet, kept a lot of familiar styles too. If that makes sense, then good :)
