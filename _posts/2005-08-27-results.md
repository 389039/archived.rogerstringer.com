So, the adsense experiments I did have had mixed results.

It pretty much depends on the visitor and what he is looking for which is what I said originally before I even tried these experiments. Will let them run a bit longer though to see how it plays out.

Last week, I bought one of those mead Zwipes erasable pen. You write with it, then use the “ink unlockerâ to undo the ink and then rub over it with the eraser on the pen. Doesn’t work. Leaves your paper with a big oily stain and the words still sit there. Save your money. Stay Away From Them!
