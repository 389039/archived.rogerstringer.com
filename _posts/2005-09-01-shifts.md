So today, I start on a new schedule at work. 6am to 2pm.

What does this mean? Simple, this means that I now have to get up at 4:30 am every morning so I can get ready for work. This makes for realllly early mornings and extremely long days, but I will handle it.

Mornings are my thing, I have no problem waking up mornings.
