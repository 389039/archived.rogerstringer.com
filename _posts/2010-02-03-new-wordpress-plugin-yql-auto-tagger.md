I like Dan’s Open Calais Auto Tagger plugin, but I found Open Calais wasn’t always quite returning the results I wanted when I used their service for specific sites. YQL lets you send content and returns tags and they’ve been relatively relevant to the post, so I forked Dan’s plugin (with his permission of course), and modified it to use YQL instead of Open Calais, the end result was this small plugin. With the YQL Auto Tagger plugin, you’ll never have to think of tags for your posts again. The plugin uses the Yahoo Query Language to perform semantic analysis of your post text and suggest tags for you. Add them to your post with just a click.
