Today is the first day of a new way of living for myself and my wife as we start the Paleo Diet. This wasn’t a spur of the moment decision, it was one that I made with a great deal of thinking and researching before making this move. Paleo is a hunter-gatherer type of diet, you cut out glutens, diary, sugars and processed foods, and focus more on a balanced diet. To quote Robb Wolf on his [website](http://robbwolf.com/faq/#overview):

> The Paleo diet is simple yet remarkably effective for fat loss and halting or preventing a number of degenerative diseases. To reap the benefits of the most effective nutritional strategy known, one need simply build meals from the following:  
>  * Lean proteins (ideally) grass fed meat, free range fowl and wild caught fish   
>  * Seasonal fruits and vegetables  
>  * Healthy fats such as nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, and coconut oil For me, it means no more processed foods and no dairy products or breads. I drive 60 kilometres each way everyday to my office and back, so it was just convenient to hit a drive thru at some point. Now, I won’t be doing that, as I put my focus on eating healthier and being healthier. It’s also eating food I enjoy eating already. If you’re interested,
