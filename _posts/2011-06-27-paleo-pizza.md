I spent some time working on the best way to make a Paleo-friendly pizza, and after some trial and error managed to combine a few online recipes into one that we liked.

Ingredients
-----------

- Crust: - 2 cups almond meal
- 2 eggs
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- ¼ tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 ½ tbsp fresh rosemary chopped
- Toppings: - 1 cup of your favourite organic marinara sauce
- 1 lb Italian pork sausage nitrate free
- 2 crook neck yellow summer squash diced
- 3 green onions chopped
- Handful of torn basil leaves
- 2 small tomatoes diced
- 1/2 cup roasted red peppers diced
- Handful of sliced black olives

Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat your oven to 350.
2. Using a spoon mix all crust ingredients together until it becomes very thick.
3. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball.
4. Lightly grease a pizza pan or a cookie sheet with olive oil.
5. Place the ball of dough in the center of your cookie sheet or pizza pan and using your hands, push and pat the dough down into the shape of a circle (or an oval in my case).
6. You want to make the dough as thin as possible.
7. Your pizza will be about 12 inches across.
8. Bake JUST the crust in your pre-heated oven for 20 minutes.
9. While your crust is cooking, prepare your toppings.
10. If you use sausage like we did, this is when you should crumble it into a large saute pan and brown.
11. After the crust if done, remove from the oven and evenly spread the marinara sauce over the crust.
12. Add the sausage and all remaining toppings evenly over the sauce and bake again for an additional 25-30 minutes.
13. Get creative and use whatever toppings you might like  ours was great but I also suggest trying chicken, artichoke hearts, and even broccoli!!
14. Go wild with it and enjoy!
